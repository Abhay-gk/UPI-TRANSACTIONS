# State-Wise Digital Payment & E-Commerce Analysis in India

## 📌 Introduction to the Problem Domain
India's digital commerce landscape has undergone a massive transformation due to rapid cashless payment adoption and the exponential growth of online shopping, especially accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially led by metro cities, Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities are now major contributors.

However, there is **no comprehensive state-wise analysis** connecting digital adoption trends with socio-economic factors.  
This project bridges that gap using **data analytics** to uncover **regional patterns** and guide **policy and business strategies** for India's digital economy.

## ❓ Statement of the Problem
India’s digital payments and e-commerce usage have surged post-COVID, but **state-wise analysis linking these trends to socio-economic conditions is missing**.

**Core Question:**  
> How do geography, infrastructure, and socio-economic conditions shape digital transaction and online shopping patterns across India?

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyse digital payment and e-commerce adoption trends across Indian states and city tiers.
- Study consumer behaviour patterns, purchasing categories, and regional disparities.
- Identify socio-economic and infrastructural factors driving digital adoption.
- Predict future digital growth hotspots and present insights via interactive dashboards.

## 🛠 Methodology
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Sources: NPCI, RBI, TRAI, Bain & Company, KPMG, Data.gov.in  
   - Data includes: digital transaction volumes, internet penetration, e-commerce usage, socio-economic indicators.
   
2. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaning, merging, and structuring datasets by **state**, **city tier**, and **time period**.  
   - Feature engineering: e.g., *UPI transactions per capita*.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Study adoption trends regionally.  
   - Compare **pre- and post-COVID patterns**.

4. **Modeling & Prediction**  
   - Clustering states by adoption patterns.  
   - Time series forecasting (Prophet) for digital growth trends.  
   - Identify socio-economic drivers.

5. **Visualization**  
   - Interactive dashboards (Power BI / Tableau).  
   - Heatmaps & charts for Tier 2/3 growth patterns.
